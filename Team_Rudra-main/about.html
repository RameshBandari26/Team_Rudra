      Team Rudra is the official Formula Student team of Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge Technologies (RGUKT), Basar, formed by a passionate group of 27 mechanical engineering students with a shared vision — to design and build the institute’s first-ever Formula Student race car and compete at FFS India 2025, a premier national-level competition hosted by FMAE.
      What began as a student initiative has grown into a full-fledged technical project, powered by determination, teamwork, and hands-on learning. We have already completed our design phase, fabricated our custom space frame chassis, and are now advancing into component manufacturing and system integration.
      Organized into 12 dedicated sub-teams, we cover every core domain of the vehicle — from drivetrain and suspension to simulation, testing, and team operations. Every component and decision is developed in-house, driven by the core belief that the best learning happens when we build it ourselves.

      <p class="text-xl font-medium">
        Team Rudra is more than a racing project — it’s a journey of engineering transformation, leadership, and innovation. We aim to become a benchmark for self-driven technical excellence, and to inspire thousands of students from similar backgrounds to chase ambitious goals and shape the future through engineering.
