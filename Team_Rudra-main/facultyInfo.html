      Dr. V. Chandra Sekhara Rao (Ph.D., IIT Madras) is an accomplished academician, research innovator, and strategic institutional leader, currently serving as Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering at RGUKT Basar. A proud alumnus of IIT Madras, he holds a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in polymer composites, fracture and durability mechanics, non-destructive testing (NDT), and eco-sustainable engineering solutions.
      <br><br>
      With over 11 years of academic, research, and administrative experience, Dr. Rao has consistently driven excellence across diverse verticals — be it in teaching, mentoring, or institutional development. His contributions have been pivotal in shaping a research-driven and innovation-centric ecosystem at RGUKT Basar.
      <br><br>
      He was one of the earliest champions of entrepreneurship and applied research on campus, having launched student innovation cells and incubation initiatives as early as 2016. Under his mentorship, RGUKT Basar celebrated its first national triumph in the Smart India Hackathon (Hardware Edition), and since then, he has guided students to file patents, develop prototypes, and win accolades at national platforms.

        <p>
          A strong proponent of interdisciplinary collaboration, Dr. Rao led a ₹12 lakh DSIR-funded research project on sustainable construction materials, and has also supervised research on lightweight composites at NIT Warangal. He has published extensively in internationally reputed journals such as Construction & Building Materials and Materials Today: Proceedings, contributing significantly to the fields of structural durability and green technologies.
        </p> <br>
        <p>
As a former Controller of Examinations, Dean (Research & Development), and Innovation Cell Coordinator, Dr. Rao spearheaded major reforms — including transparent UG admissions, restructuring of examination protocols post-2019, and the establishment of cutting-edge laboratories from scratch, such as the Strength of Materials Lab.
</p><br>
<p>
He has facilitated 25+ MoUs with premier global and national institutions, enabling students to access internships, research pathways, and skill certifications from partners like Microsoft, SAP, Wells Fargo, and foreign universities. Nearly 30 students have gained international exposure under his guidance.
</p><br> <p>
His recognitions include being the first RGUKT Basar faculty to file a patent, and being honoured with the Telangana State Best Teacher Award in 2024 — a testimony to his dedication, vision, and influence in academic reform and student empowerment.
</p> <br>
<p>Currently, he continues to be the driving force behind multiple faculty development programs (FDPs), certification courses (such as SOLIDWORKS), startup mentoring, and research proposals. His mentorship bridges the gap between academic knowledge and real-world engineering, shaping students into professionals who are technically sound, socially conscious, and globally competitive.
