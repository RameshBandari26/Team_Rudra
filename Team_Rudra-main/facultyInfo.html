      Dr. V. Chandra Sekhara Rao (Ph.D., IIT Madras) is an accomplished academician, research innovator, and strategic institutional leader, currently serving as Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering at RGUKT Basar. A proud alumnus of IIT Madras, he holds a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering, specializing in polymer composites, fracture and durability mechanics, non-destructive testing (NDT), and eco-sustainable engineering solutions.
      <br><br>
      With over 11 years of academic, research, and administrative experience, Dr. Rao has consistently driven excellence across diverse verticals — be it in teaching, mentoring, or institutional development. His contributions have been pivotal in shaping a research-driven and innovation-centric ecosystem at RGUKT Basar.
      <br><br>
      He was one of the earliest champions of entrepreneurship and applied research on campus, having launched student innovation cells and incubation initiatives as early as 2016. Under his mentorship, RGUKT Basar celebrated its first national triumph in the Smart India Hackathon (Hardware Edition), and since then, he has guided students to file patents, develop prototypes, and win accolades at national platforms.
